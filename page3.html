              <h6>is an immigration option for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States before the age of 16 to recieve a renweable two-year period of deferred action from deportation, work authorization and the ability to apply for a social security number. Recipients cannot have felonies or serious misdemeanors on their records in order to be eligible for this program. Unlike the proposed DREAM Act, DACA does not provide a pathway to lawful permanent residence to the recipients, known as Dreamers. The policy was announced and in action in the summer of 2012. </h6>

              <h3>The DREAM Act (short for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act) </h3>
          </par>
          <par>
              <h6>was a bill in Congress that would have granted legal status to certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children and went to school here. Although several versions of the bill have been introduced in Congress since 2001, it has never passed. In the last few years the term “DREAMer” has been used to describe young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, who have lived and gone to school here, and who in many cases identify as American. The term DREAMer originally took its name from the bill in Congress, but it has a double meaning about the undocumented youth who have big hopes and dreams for a better future.</h6>
