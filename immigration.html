    Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is an agency under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) along with two other agencies: Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Citizenship Services.
    ICE was created in 2003 as a response to the Sept. 11 2001, attacks.

  <div>
    ICE Is Made Up Of Three Offices:
    </div>
    <div>
    Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, Homeland Security Investigations, and Enforcement and Removal Operations.
Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) is the smallest division and is a legal program with over 1,100 attorneys. They represent the government during immigration courts. The attorneys provide support by prosecuting ICE cases and defending the ICE authorities in federal court.
Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is the largest division and it is the investigative component of DHS. HSI has broad legal authority to investigate all types of cross-border criminal activity such as drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, human trafficking, cybercrimes, financial crimes, and identity fraud. It is also the lead government agency for counterproliferation investigations, and targets individuals who illegally attempt to smuggle military and other high-tech equipment out of the United States.
