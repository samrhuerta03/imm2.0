    <p>The Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy announced in April 2018 led to the separation of thousands of families, sparking a national outcry. The "Zero tolerance policy," which separated migrant families in an attempt to discourage the number of migrants appearing at the U.S. border with Mexico. Initial tallies estimated that some 3,000 families were separated under the policy, but an investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General earlier this year found that thousands more families were likely impacted </p>

    <p>Heartbreaking images and videos of weeping children and loved ones spread rapidly on social media Wednesday night after Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested nearly 700 workers at several Mississippi food processing plants in a series of coordinated raids that were described as “the largest single-state workplace enforcement action in U.S. history.” Kids were left with no family members to take care for them, they were taken away their most loved ones at the most unexpected moment in your life. A total of 680 people were arrested in Wednesday's raids, but about 300 migrants have been released since the arrests, and at least 377 more are still in ICE custody, according to Jere Miles, special agent in charge for the Department of Homeland Security</p>

  <p>“They wanted a better future for their girl,” María Estela Ávalos, Vanessa’s mother, told The Washington Post. They traveled more than 1,000 miles seeking it. Once in the United States, they planned to ask for asylum, for refuge from the violence that drives many Central American migrants from their home countries every day. But the farthest the family got was an international bridge in Matamoros, Mexico. Authorities detained more than 144,000 people at the border last month, as migration levels reached their highest point since 2006. Those record numbers, and a Rio Grande swollen from spring runoff, have made for especially perilous crossings in recent weeks.

     <p> Every family has a different story. Some have successful but still give back to the community that has helped them grow. Every family that has arrived here have made huge sacrifices and struggled to lead their family. Rodnia and her mother Rosario are small business owners and the first generation of their family to come to America. They have been here for many years and seek to enrich the community that they call home economically and culturally. “We begin selling lamb tacos on the weekends from 8am – 2pm on a driveway under a tent with three folding tables. It was a great success. Just three months later we were buying 500-600 pounds of lamb and our customers were spreading the word of our authentic Mexican food to all of their friends and family.” In just three months El Borrego became a vital part of the community. “That’s when we decided to open El Borrego the Restaurant.”
