        <p class="title">CEO &amp; Main researcher</p>
        <p>My name is Edilia Bueno. I currently live in Mount Vernon, NY and a rising senior at Sacred Heart Greenwich. I was born and raised in a beautiful tropical island, the Dominican Republic. My mother and I immigrated to the United States 2006. It was a challenge to adjust the culture here. We did not know out rights, or support on getting myself an education. This website captures a hope for your protection. It will help you gain knowledge on information that the government will not tell you. This will give you a chance to give your children a better education. I know how it feels to have nothing or not having anyone’s support. However, my team and I have confidence that you will be able to defeat your destiny. Anything is possible if you have faith. </p>

          <h2>Samantha Huerta</h2>
        <p class="title">CEO &amp; Main programmer</p>
          <p>My name is Samantha Huerta. I will be a rising junior in the fall of 2019 at St.Catharine Academy, situated in the Bronx. I am looking forward to all my courses, especially the 4 AP’s I thought was a good idea to sign up for. Partaking in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program has allowed me to learn more about coding and the various professions that use it, which has increased my interest in pursuing a career as a software engineer. I am very grateful for the knowledge, opportunities, and friendships the program has offered me.  </p>
        <p>Being a first generation daughter of immigrant parents has allowed me to see first hand the struggles and discrimination my parents experience. It is because of those struggles that i am deeply connected with this project. With the help of my other 4 teammates, we were able to create a website that helps everyone in the United States. As the main programmer I was in charge of creating the backbone of the website, design aspect of the home page and creators page, and assisting my teammates in regards to the website code. As a CEO of the website, the two other CEO’s and I created the idea of this website and were in charge of the setup/design aspect of the overall website. </p>

      <figcaption>Hi, I am Hadia Miah. I am currently a rising senior at the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics. I love programming and shooting make-up videos on my cell phone. I recently finished a 7-week long competitive Summer Immersion Program at Girls Who Code. At the program, my teammates and I are seeking to emphasize the importance of understanding immigration in the United States. This website captures my passion for advocating for human rights and helping to raise awareness about important issues in the world. My vision is to provide informative facts and analysis for immigrants so that they can make more informed decisions. As the daughter of first-generation immigrant parents, I saw them struggle hard, many a time due to misinformation and misguidance. I want to make it smooth and easy for immigrants to access resources and information to improve their lives.

    <h2>Ericka Rivas</h2>
    <p class="title">Co programer &amp; Co researcher</p>
    <p>My name is Ericka Rivas, I'm currently a senior year in Peekskill High School, I spend my time on computers and playing soccer. I'm excited about starting my college process and following my  dream major computer science. The summer of 2019 I spent my summer at Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, where I learned all about coding programs and robots, I can definitely say this program has helped me and changed my mindset on my career.</p>
    <p>My final project for the program was creating this website with four classmates which we were all passionate about, I worked on the code for media and citations pages of this website. I personally was really passionate because I am the first generation daughter of immigrant parents who came many years ago looking for a better life for themselves and I. </p>
